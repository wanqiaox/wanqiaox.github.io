About Me
======
I'm a third-year Ph.D. student at Stanford University. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Benjamin Van Roy](https://web.stanford.edu/~bvr/index.html). Previously, I received a B.S. degree in honors mathematics with a minor in computer science from the University of Michigan. During my undergraduate years, I had the pleasure of working with [Prof. Hamsa Bastani](https://hamsabastani.github.io/), [Prof. Osbert Bastani](https://obastani.github.io/), and [Prof. Ruiwei Jiang](https://sites.google.com/site/ruiweijianguf/). 

Research Interests
======
My research interest primarily lies in reinforcement learning. I aspire to design agents that learn to make decisions efficiently under complex, uncertain environments. Recently, I am also excited about designing efficient and principled methods for fine-tuning language models with human feedback. 

Professional Experience
======
- Research Intern, Meta, 2023.
