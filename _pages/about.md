About Me
======
I'm a second-year Ph.D. student at Stanford University, advised by [Benjamin Van Roy](https://web.stanford.edu/~bvr/index.html). Previously, I received a B.S. degree in honors mathematics with a minor in computer science from the University of Michigan. 

Research Interests
======
My research interest primarily lies in reinforcement learning. I aspire to design agents that learn to make decisions efficiently under complex, uncertain environments.
